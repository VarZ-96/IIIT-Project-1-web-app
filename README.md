Hello everyone, I am Varshil Pandey , this is my first project for my college and i m very excited about it. I have not completed it yet as I will connect it with the backend but it will take time so for now u can enjoy the front end :) . Also please watch my website in a 1920*1080 screen as i have not added media queries right now sorry for inconvinience :( . If you are having any problems in viewing it in your desktop make sure that in your display settings 100% is the selected size or rather just use " 'CTRL' + '+' " shortcut unless the top nav bar comes in one line.
